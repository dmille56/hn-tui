# Theme Help
Themes are defined in custom .ini files. hn-tui uses the theming of the haskell library [brick](https://github.com/jtdaugherty/brick). A useful description of how to use custom themes is available in the brick library's documentation. Some knowledge of the haskell library [vty](https://github.com/jtdaugherty/vty) may also be useful. See example.ini for an example theme.
